# minecraft-server-gcp

a minecraft server using Google Cloud Platform

for fun :)

## notes

You need java 7/8 for some packs.

See scripts and GitHub releases :)

### really old modpacks, i.e. java 7

you need to run it with Java 1.7 - download here:

https://github.com/HenryFBP/minecraft-server-gcp/releases/download/jdk-7-windows-64/jdk-7u80-windows-x64.exe

then, you need to edit the run options on your Minecraft instance to use Java 1.7

This may look different depending on what launcher you use.

My Java 7 is installed at `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_80`
