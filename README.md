# minecraft-server-gcp

a minecraft server using Google Cloud Platform

for fun :)

## notes

You need java 7/8 for some packs.

See scripts and GitHub releases :)

### really old modpacks, i.e. java 7

you need to run it with Java 1.7 - download here:

https://github.com/HenryFBP/minecraft-server-gcp/releases/download/jdk-7-windows-64/jdk-7u80-windows-x64.exe

then, you need to edi tthe run optinos on your Minecraft instance tro use Java 1.7
